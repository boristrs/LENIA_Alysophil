# LENIA_Alysophil

The aim of this repository is to present a modified and original version of the Lenia game of life. It is a crash test carried out in a limited time for the Alysophil company.

In this version of the game of life, a molecule whose olfactory properties (green, herbal, woody) have been predicted in another project is used as the initial pattern. The carbon atoms and bonds correspond to an initial state of 1. Oxygen and hydrogen correspond to states 0.75 and 0.5 respectively. Two kernels are superimposed to represent the company logo. The grow function used is a Gaussian curve centred on 0.15 to reflect the slogan "Less is more". 

Depending on the settings of the growfunction (its mean and standard deviation), the results observed are either a disappearance of the molecule pattern or the appearance of a chaotic pattern. 

To go further, it would be interesting to use a channel for each type of atom. The kernels could remain identical. The grow function should be unique and multiple to simulate the different affinities between different atoms.
